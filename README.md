# Final Project: Lung Nodule Classification

In this project, I referred to this paper [Lung Nodule Classification using Deep Local-Global Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10126) and the official implementation from this [GitHub](https://github.com/mundher/local-global). Then I improved the performance by building a new model.

## Dataset
I used the same data as the above paper and it had already been preprocessed. The data was extracted from LIDC-IDRI whcih was a public dataset for lung cancer analysis. 

## Model Architecture
